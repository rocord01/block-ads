# Let's encourage ad blocking

**[Are you protected against ads?](https://blockads.fivefilters.org)**

The purpose of this project is to test for and encourage the use of ad blockers. 

It's a simple test to see if you have an ad blocker installed, and a recommendation to install one if you don't. We do not believe in '[acceptable advertising](https://github.com/fivefilters/block-ads/wiki/There-are-no-acceptable-ads)' so we also try to test for that and suggest a better adblocker if we detect it. 

The intention is to have a page you can send to family and friends. When they access it, they will get a recommendation for an ad blocker that will run on their browser or device.

We recommend the appropriate [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) browser extension if we detect Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera or Microsoft Edge.

We recommend [Focus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337) for iOS (although now that it's also a browser rather than the lighter content blocker it was before, better recommendations are welcome).

See our [Block Ads! update](http://blog.fivefilters.org/post/149982581337/block-ads-update) for information on what we look for in an ad blocker.

### Try it!

The code here is running on our site at: [blockads.fivefilters.org](https://blockads.fivefilters.org)

Feel free to share that page with anyone you feel could benefit from more ad blocking.
